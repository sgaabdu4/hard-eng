# Schedule, roles + models

Load to start or change the schedule, or to start a worker. Use the section for the host that runs the coordinator. Unattended runs cannot answer prompts: allow the script, git and network access in that host's project permissions, then prove it with one manual run of the same command.

## T3 Code

- Schedule = on every run, `list_scheduled_tasks`; none for this thread → `schedule_task` bound to it, interval `timing.everyMinutes`, prompt "Run the trello-coordinator skill." The first manual run sets it up; tell the owner once.
- Workers = `delegate_task` with `target.providerInstanceId` = the role's `provider` (none set → the coordinator's own provider) and `target.model` = its `model`, `isolation: "worktree"`, `clientRequestId` `card<N>-r<round>`. Follow-ups = `t3_thread_send` to the worker's thread. Mixed Claude + GPT roles work here.
- Builder after a planner on the same card = `delegate_task` without `isolation`; the brief names the planner's worktree path from `handover.md` and says to work only there. Start it only after the planner has ended.
- Stalls = read worker threads; follow each task's own wake-up instead of polling. Cancel = `task_cancel`.

### Missing key or token

Ask with `request_secret`, `delivery: "file"`, one value at a time, key first. Then `save-secret <name> <file>` with the file path given, and `probe`. Copy each popup text exactly; fill `<account>` from `trello.json`.

- Key: label `Trello API key`; placeholder `32 letters and numbers`; reason:
  > The Trello coordinator needs your Trello API key. It is saved only on this computer, in a file git never uploads.
  > 1. Open https://trello.com/apps/admin and sign in to Trello as <account>. If Trello asks you to accept the Joint Development Agreement, accept it.
  > 2. Already have an app on that page? Click its name. If not, click New, choose "My app doesn't use Power-Up capabilities", fill in Name (for example Coordinator), Workspace, Email, Support Email and Author, then click Create.
  > 3. Click the Trello Auth tab. If no key shows, click Generate a new API Key.
  > 4. Copy the API key and paste it here.
- Token: label `Trello token`; placeholder `Long code from the Allow page`; reason:
  > Now the token. With it, the coordinator can read and write your Trello boards, so keep it secret. It is saved only on this computer.
  > 1. Go back to the Trello Auth tab from the last step.
  > 2. Click the word Token to the right of the API key.
  > 3. Check that the page shows <account>, then click Allow.
  > 4. Copy the long code on the next page and paste it here.
- `save-secret` refuses the paste → ask again with the same text and one line saying what was wrong. `probe` names another account → stop and say which account the token belongs to.

## Claude Code

- In a session = `/loop <everyMinutes>m Run the trello-coordinator skill.`; it stops when the session closes.
- Unattended = an OS timer (launchd or cron) runs `claude -p "Run the trello-coordinator skill."` from the repository root; each run is a new session, so workers continue from their handover notes.
- Workers = subagents with the role's `model` in their own worktree; follow-ups = message the same subagent while the session lives. Claude models only.

- Missing key or token = no popup here: stop and give the same steps, then the two lines to add to `.env.trello.local` in the main checkout.

## Codex

- Schedule = an OS timer runs `codex exec "Run the trello-coordinator skill." < /dev/null` from the repository root; Codex has no built-in schedule.
- Workers = Codex subagents with the role's model, continued from handover notes across runs. OpenAI models only. Missing key or token = as in Claude Code.

## Roles + models

- `trello.json` `roles` = the coordinator's model per role, each with a `why`, written for the host that runs the coordinator; they override the project's general model-role rule for coordinator workers. No `roles` → use the default split with this host's own models. Default split: coordinator = cheaper model, routing only; planner + reviewer = strongest model, judgment; builder = mid model, carries out a clear plan; lookup = fastest model, reads and reports; computerUse = the host's computer-use model, needed to check signed-in screens.
- A role's model unavailable on this host → say so and stop that role's work; never substitute another model. Moving the coordinator to another host = edit `roles` for that host first.
- Model change = edit `trello.json`; running workers finish on their old model.
- Timing, chase hours and quiet hours come from `trello.json` `timing`; no message to people inside `quietHours` unless urgent.
