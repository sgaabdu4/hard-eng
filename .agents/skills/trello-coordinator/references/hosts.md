# Schedule, roles + models

Load to start or change the schedule, or to start a worker. Use the section for the host that runs the coordinator. Unattended runs cannot answer prompts: allow the script, git and network access in that host's project permissions, then prove it with one manual run of the same command.

## T3 Code

- Schedule = `schedule_task` bound to the coordinator thread, interval `timing.everyMinutes`; prompt = "Run the trello-coordinator skill."
- Workers = `delegate_task` with `target.providerInstanceId` = the role's `provider` (none set → the coordinator's own provider) and `target.model` = its `model`, `isolation: "worktree"`, `clientRequestId` `card<N>-r<round>`. Follow-ups = `t3_thread_send` to the worker's thread. Mixed Claude + GPT roles work here.
- Builder after a planner on the same card = `delegate_task` without `isolation`; the brief names the planner's worktree path from `handover.md` and says to work only there. Start it only after the planner has ended.
- Stalls = read worker threads; follow each task's own wake-up instead of polling. Cancel = `task_cancel`.

## Claude Code

- In a session = `/loop <everyMinutes>m Run the trello-coordinator skill.`; it stops when the session closes.
- Unattended = an OS timer (launchd or cron) runs `claude -p "Run the trello-coordinator skill."` from the repository root; each run is a new session, so workers continue from their handover notes.
- Workers = subagents with the role's `model` in their own worktree; follow-ups = message the same subagent while the session lives. Claude models only.

## Codex

- Schedule = an OS timer runs `codex exec "Run the trello-coordinator skill." < /dev/null` from the repository root; Codex has no built-in schedule.
- Workers = Codex subagents with the role's model, continued from handover notes across runs. OpenAI models only.

## Roles + models

- `trello.json` `roles` = the coordinator's model per role, each with a `why`, written for the host that runs the coordinator; they override the project's general model-role rule for coordinator workers. Default split: coordinator = cheaper model, routing only; planner + reviewer = strongest model, judgment; builder = mid model, carries out a clear plan; lookup = fastest model, reads and reports; computerUse = the host's computer-use model, needed to check signed-in screens.
- A role's model unavailable on this host → say so and stop that role's work; never substitute another model. Moving the coordinator to another host = edit `roles` for that host first.
- Model change = edit `trello.json`; running workers finish on their old model.
- Timing, chase hours and quiet hours come from `trello.json` `timing`; no message to people inside `quietHours` unless urgent.
